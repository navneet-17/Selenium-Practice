Custom Path: Jenkins File Downloader

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates how to use **Selenium WebDriver with ChromeOptions** to automatically download files to a custom path.  
The example specifically downloads the **Jenkins WAR file** (`jenkins.war`) into a user-defined folder (`Jenkins Download`).

---

## ⚙️ Features
- Creates a **machine-independent download directory** (`Jenkins Download`).
- Configures Chrome browser preferences to:
  - Set a custom download path.
  - Disable download prompts.
- Automates the download of `jenkins.war` from the Jenkins official site.
- Validates whether the file has been downloaded successfully within a given wait time.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Java  
- Selenium WebDriver  
- ChromeDriver

## 🚀 How It Works
1. Creates a folder named `Jenkins Download` in the project directory.  
2. Configures ChromeOptions to set the download path.  
3. Launches Chrome and navigates to the Jenkins WAR file URL.  
4. Waits until the file `jenkins.war` is downloaded or timeout occurs.  
5. Prints the result in the console.
